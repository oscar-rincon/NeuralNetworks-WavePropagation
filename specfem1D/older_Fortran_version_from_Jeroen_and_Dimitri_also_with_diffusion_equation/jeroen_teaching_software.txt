Hi Dimitri:

I am teaching part of a course in computational geophysics this quarter. For this reason I put together the basic software for students to do 1D simulations of the wave equation and the diffusion equation based upon the spectral-element method.

What I have in mind is to give them the basic subroutines lagrange_poly.f90, gll_library.f90, and define_derivative_matrix.f90, and to ask them to write the small programs wave.f90 and diffusion.f90 based upon class notes. This way they can get a pretty good feel for how the method works.
