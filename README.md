# Installation

We recommend setting up a new Python environment. You can do this by running the following commands:

 ```
 conda create --name comparative-nn-wave-env
 conda activate comparative-nn-wave-env
 ```

Next, clone this repository by using the command:

 ```
git clone https://github.com/oscar-rincon/NeuralNetworks-WavePropagation.git
 ```

Finally, navigate to the base `NeuralNetworks-WavePropagation/` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

 ```
 conda env update --name comparative-nn-wave-env --file comparative_nn_wave_env.yaml
 ```

To verify the packages installed in your `comparative-nn-wave-env` conda environment, you can use the following command:

 ```
 conda list -n comparative-nn-wave-env
 ```
